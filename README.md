# Inverted Pendulum

Started model of Inverted Pendulum, to use for different control approaches.
The following steps can be expected:

- Simulation of an inverted pendulum model, with a single force on the cart.
- Controlling the cart using optimal control.
- Controlling the cart using Deep Reinforcement Learning, or another self-learning approach.
- (Optional) building robot to mimic.
- (Optional) make model more complex by adding second pivot point.
